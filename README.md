# Macintosh-IIci-Reloaded
Near 1:1 Reproduction of the Macintosh IIci Logicboard

As of V3.0 the board now includes footprints for both the original double simm sockets as well as the closer spaced ones commonly used on PC boards. Either (or a combination of both) can be used, single sockets will also fit just fine. Do not attempt to install more than 8 sockets in any config.
